I made this repo because I was unable to push anything via normal forking and
cloning. If you checkout any commits from THIS repo, please know that it might
not work when you run the tests or simulations because the repo may not contain
the EXACT same files as the one from the specific checkout commits of the tutorial.

For example, my Step 5 will have all the files that were changed along
with the experiments that I completed when I went through the tutorial, 
but it will not work when running it in this repo since this repo has 
different settings defined in all the config files and it won't read the 
phone.json. It DOES work when I use the same changes in
the central repo with the corresponding step-5 commit checked out.

In other words, the commits in this repo just reflect what I did in the tutorial,
not necessarily functioning code of the app with this specific repo.
